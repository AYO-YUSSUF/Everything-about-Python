# Everything-about-Python
The python language is one of the most accessible programming languages available because it has simplified syntax and not complicated, which gives more emphasis on natural language. Due to its ease of learning and usage, python codes can be easily written and executed much faster than other programming languages.

When Guido van Rossum was creating python in the 1980s, he made sure to design it to be a general-purpose language. One of the main reasons for the popularity of python would be its simplicity in syntax so that it could be easily read and understood even by amateur developers also.

Due to its corporate sponsorship and big supportive community of python, python has excellent libraries that you can use to select and save your time and effort on the initial cycle of development. There are also lots of cloud media services that offer cross-platform support through library-like tools, which can be extremely beneficial.

Libraries with specific focus are also available like nltk for natural language processing or scikit-learn for machine learning applications.

There are many frameworks and libraries are available for python language, such as:

- matplotib for plotting charts and graphs
- SciPy for engineering applications, science, and mathematics
- BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing and XML
- NumPy for scientific computing
- Django for server-side web development
